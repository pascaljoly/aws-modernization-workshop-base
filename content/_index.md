# AWS Modernization Workshop

### Welcome

Why Cloud Automation at Scale?
- Everyone in the organization (developers, QA, ITOps, DevOps) needs applications environments in the cloud
- The Problem is that expertise is a bottleneck. Cloud experts are in high demand. Not all developers are Cloud Experts.
- This creates islands of automation with inconsistencies across the organization
- It also results in insufficient guardrails around security/compliance and cost


### Learning Objectives
Gourmet Inc provides gourmet food delivery services. They wants to deploy their new promotion manager web application to AWS in time for the holiday season. 
This is a new user experience for their Foody shoppers, and this upgrade should significantly impact sales for the quarter. Quality is paramount.
The engineering, DevOps and IT teams are under pressure to deliver this in a short amount of time and handle any subsequent upgrade with minimal delays.
Gourmet Inc also wants this approach to be applicable to other applications within the company, as well as be compliant to PCI for credit card payment.
You are the trusted DevOps expert in the Company and in charge of the project success. This is a great opportunity for you so you are highly motivated!
